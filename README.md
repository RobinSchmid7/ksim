# ksim

This is K-Scale's library for running simulation experiments.

## Getting Started

First, create a new Conda environment (note that there is a [known issue](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/issues/11) with running Genesis in uv, so it's recommended to use Conda instead):

```bash
conda create -n ksim python=3.11
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
